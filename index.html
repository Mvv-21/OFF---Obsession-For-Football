        <h2>About our logo</h2>
        <p>
            Our logo has gone trough different processes to get to where it is. This was the first version of the logo after making several designs and discussions. It had the letters OFF and the lines around it represented a football. This version had many things to improve that were changed with the next version.

        <h2>Our second version</h2>
        <p>
            We decided to change the tone of blue and switched the lines and letters to white for better contrast. This improved a lot the logo but we decided to change the solid colors to gradients, making the logo much more elaborated and better looking. Now it is the actual logo but it may not be the final version.
